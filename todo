Doppelganger - need to finish implementation of methods to call doppelganger at night in a reveal roles game where the doppelganger has an action (like seer) to perform
			- implement a copied side so numbers will still be correct

Seer - second seer mostly done, need to check for bugs and crashes

Status table - maybe implement so that current active players are highlighted? Maybe in bold?

Fix drunk werewolf bug

Hunter bug killing twice after death at night
